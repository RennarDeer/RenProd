        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Ren!</h2>
        <p>
            A little bit about myself, I'm Rennar, or Ren for short. I'm a 25 year old girl from North Dakota
            who is currently living in Chicago, Illinois. My hobbies are mainly focused on my home lab, and security research.
            <br><br>
            My other hobbies include a little bit of light gaming when I have the time, skateboarding, tinkering, and photography.</center>

        <h2>pwnOS Boot to Root</h2>

        <img src="boot2root.png" alt="Boot2Root">

        Since Microsoft Azure decided to nuke my whole website and does not offer backups without
        paying for them, I'm going to keep this short and sweet.

            <br><br>
        
        pwnOS 2.0 isn't known as a difficult box to break into, but it makes for a good starting out
        point for people new to CTFs. A quick rundown of this box is that it is a simple blog for a
        company, running a vulnerable version of SimplePHP. Executing a remote command to reset
        the admin password is a fairly simple perl script that comes with Kali Linux, after running it,
        you can log into the site. 
        
            <br><br>

        This doesn't get you very far, but you'll be able to upload ANY file
        you would like. So naturally I set up netcat, uploaded and ran a reverse shell. After this its
        fairly trivial to find the root password in a config file the website owner left us, and now
        we can directly ssh into the box as root, completing this CTF.

        <h3>Going over the homelab</h2>
        
                        <img src="rackpic.JPG" alt="RensRack">
        
                        I have FINALLY unpacked my rack here in Chicago, so now I can do a little bit of writing about it! 
                    
                            <br><br>
                        

                        First up is the antique on my rack, a Dell Poweredge 2950 rackmounted server, it's completely
                        maxed out with 16GB of DDR2 RAM and 2 Xeon processors. All it does is run pfSense. On pfSense
                        I have a few VLANs set up for IoT devices, one for my pentesting lab, and one for my "secure" 
                        systems, such as my laptop, desktop, and the server I actually want to be able to reach out 
                        to the internet as a whole. I also run SNORT on this system for an IPS for a little more piece 
                        of mind.
                    
                            <br><br> 

                        The more modern server is my Dell r820, running ESXI 6.7, on which I have my pentesting lab, 
                        along with a samba server, and in the future will probably run this website once I'm more confident
                        in my webdev skills! In fact, you may be accessing this webpage running on that server right now and 
                        I just haven't updated the website yet to tell you guys! Other things that run on this server are a
                        couple of Kali boxes, along with some vulnerable machines to toy around with in my free time without
                        clogging up my laptop's storage with virtual machines.

                            <br><br> 

                        Last but not least is my two cisco switches, one 2960x and an sg300. Not much to be said about these,
                        while I am familiar with the Cisco ecosystem from 2 years of Cisco networking class, I did not feel 
                        the need to set up much on them past the initial changing passwords, due to pfSense pretty much handling
                        everything. The SG300 is set up to actually access the internet, while the 2960x is only an internal
                        network, and runs my pentesting lab.

                            <br><br>

                        That about sums it up, in the future I plan on setting up a PLEX server on the r820, along with expanding
                        the storage to store media files and have a proper RAID config instead of the current RAID0 array (this is
                        simply due to limitations on how much money I can throw at 2.5" SAS drives and SSD's). Hopefully this was 
                        interesting, and I will keep this updated as I add new things and new services to my ecosystem!
